# MySQLConnect

I have php mysql Connect Class and python mysql Connect Class. You can use my classes.

Php class has constructor method. You have to fill constructor method's parameters. Parameters are host, user, password
, database_name  and then connectMySQL method is need to run. If you don't run the method, you will have errors about 
connect MySQL. My php class has support methods. Just you have to write sql code for support methods's parameters.
